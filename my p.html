    "that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lodr jesus and shalt believein thine 
    heart that GOD hath raised him from the dead ,thou shalt be saved for with 
    the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made into 
    salvation" that peaple know that jesus is only way ,truth,eternal life no one can
     enter in heaven  without receive jesus as king and saviour of his/her life 
    that it is first step </p>
     
    <p> after receiving jesus as saviour and king  of your your life know you are 
        saved as <STRONG> JOhN CHAPTER 1:12</STRONG>"but as many as received him to them 
        gave he power to become the sons of God ,even to them that believe on his name"
        after that you are child of God<br>
